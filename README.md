This repository contains lab reports for the course VL-403: CMOS Digital IC Design. Each lab is archived in a structured and reproducible format, including the final report, LaTeX source, and all figures used.

Every ZIP file contains the final compiled PDF report, the complete LaTeX source file used to generate the report, and a folder named “Images Used” that includes all schematics, plots, and figures referenced in the report.

Tools Used Cadence Virtuoso and SCL 180nm PDK.

Lab-wise Description:
Lab-1 Contains:
DC characteristic analysis of NMOS and PMOS transistors through simulation, including ID–VGS and ID–VDS plots, extraction of threshold voltage (Vth) using the √ID extrapolation method, estimation of drain saturation voltage (VDSAT), and analysis of the body effect by varying source-to-bulk voltage (VSB).

Lab-2 Contains:
Design and analysis of a CMOS inverter in 180 nm technology, including extraction of switching threshold (VM), noise margins (NMH, NML), and propagation delays (tpHL, tpLH), along with parametric studies on PMOS sizing, input rise time, load capacitance, and evaluation of inverter-based buffer configurations.

Lab-4 Contains:
Design and performance analysis of two-input CMOS NAND and NOR gates in 180 nm technology, including switching threshold extraction, propagation delay analysis under equal and unequal input transitions, and detailed static and dynamic power dissipation comparison with a reference CMOS inverter.

Lab-5 Contains:
Design and comparative transistor-level analysis of CMOS full adder architectures (basic, NAND-based, and 2×1 MUX-based) and a 4-bit ripple carry adder, evaluating power consumption, worst-case propagation delay, transistor count, and carry-chain delay scaling.

Lab-7 Contains:
Design and timing–power analysis of CMOS sequential elements including SR flip-flop, synchronous and asynchronous D flip-flops, and a C2MOS register, with extraction of setup time, hold time, clock-to-Q delay, power consumption, and maximum operating frequency in 180 nm technology. 

Lab-8 Contains:
Design and performance evaluation of advanced CMOS register architectures—C2MOS dual-edge triggered register, true single-phase clock (TSPC) register, and pulse-triggered register—analyzing edge-triggering behavior, setup/hold times, clock overlap sensitivity, pulse width control, and timing trade-offs.

Lab-9 Contains:
Design and timing analysis of 4×4 unsigned and signed CMOS multipliers, including array multiplier and Baugh-Wooley architectures, with critical-path identification, propagation-delay measurement, and verification of two’s-complement signed multiplication.
